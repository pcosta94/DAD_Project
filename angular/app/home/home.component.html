      <h1>Welcome to Sueca</h1>
      <p>
      Sueca (meaning Swedish (female) in Portuguese) is a 4 player-partnership point trick-taking card game,
       and a popular variant of the Bisca card game. The game is played in Portugal, Brazil and Angola and other 
       Portuguese communities. Its closest relative is the very similar German game Einwerfen.
